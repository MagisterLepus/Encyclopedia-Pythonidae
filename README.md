# Encyclopedia-Pythonidae
Offline encyclopedia for learning Python. End goal is to have a free, open-source application.
Currently a WIP, closed to select individuals working on it until it is ready for release. 
Initial purpose is for personal use, but can be adapted for public use depending on usability.
